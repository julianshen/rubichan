# Modular Redesign Review — A Minimal Core with Modules

**Status:** Proposal / design review
**Date:** 2026-07-16
**Question:** Can we redesign Rubichan around a *minimal core with modules*, so that we don't have to bind everything together (TUI, skills, security, ACP, …) into one unit — making the agent easy to extend and easy to embed in other apps? Inspired by the design philosophy of [pi.dev](https://pi.dev/).

---

## 1. TL;DR

**Yes — and the codebase is already halfway there, but the two halves have drifted apart.**

- The *dependency direction* is mostly correct: the TUI, provider, and tool layers point **at** the core, not the other way around. `internal/agent` does **not** import Bubble Tea or the TUI, and the core talks to the outside world through a channel of `TurnEvent`s. That is the right shape.
- The *core itself is not minimal*. `internal/agent.Agent` has become a **god object**: a 2,910-line `agent.go`, a struct with **~60 fields**, and **35 `With…` constructor options** that bind in checkpointing, knowledge graph, persona, memory, auto-dream, compaction strategies, ACP, budget, wake manager, prefetch, and more. You cannot take "just the loop" without transitively dragging in ~18 internal packages.
- There are effectively **two divergent agent stacks**. The *type contracts* are shared — `internal` aliases the SDK types (`tools.Tool = agentsdk.Tool`, `provider.LLMProvider = agentsdk.LLMProvider`, `sdk_aliases.go` re-exports the rest) — but the *behavior* is duplicated:
  1. `pkg/agentsdk` — a clean, public, **506-line** minimal agent loop with **zero `internal/` imports**, plus its own concrete `Registry`. This is the "embed in other apps" story.
  2. `internal/agent` — the **2,910-line** monolith the real app (TUI, headless, wiki, ACP) actually runs on, with a separate `runLoop` and a separate concrete `internal/tools.Registry`.
  So the *interfaces* line up but the *loop is written twice* and has diverged. External embedders get the toy loop; the real capability is locked in `internal/`.
- `cmd/rubichan/main.go` is **3,383 lines** and imports ~40 internal packages — this is the actual "bind everything together" point.

**Recommendation:** Collapse to **one** minimal core that both the SDK and the full app share, and move every optional subsystem behind a small set of **module extension seams** (tool provider, middleware/hooks, context strategy, event sink, transport). This is exactly pi.dev's "small core with programmable edges," and it is an *incremental, structural* refactor — no behavior change required to start.

---

## 2. What "good" looks like — the pi.dev model

Pi decomposes into four deliberately decoupled packages ([pi.dev](https://pi.dev/), [mariozechner.at](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/)):

| pi package | Responsibility | Rubichan analogue |
|---|---|---|
| `pi-ai` | Provider abstraction over many LLM APIs, streaming, tool-calling, serialization | `internal/provider` + `pkg/agentsdk` provider iface — **already clean** |
| `pi-agent-core` | The loop: tool execution, validation, event emission, **transport abstraction** (direct / JSON-stream / RPC) | *split & duplicated* across `pkg/agentsdk` and `internal/agent` |
| `pi-tui` | A **replaceable** rendering layer built *on top of* the core | `internal/tui` — **already only imported by `main`** |
| `pi-coding-agent` | The harness that wires everything: config, sessions, slash commands, context files | `cmd/rubichan` — **3,383-line `main.go`, the binding point** |

Principles worth stealing:

1. **Small core, programmable edges.** The core ships a loop and a handful of tools; *everything else* (todos, plan mode, sub-agents, background jobs) is externalized to the filesystem or CLI rather than baked in. "What you leave out matters more than what you put in."
2. **The core is an SDK first, a CLI second.** `pi-agent-core` runs headless via JSON streaming / RPC. The TUI is one consumer among many.
3. **Tools return dual-format results** — text for the LLM, structured data for the UI — so no UI type leaks into the core.
4. **Fewer tools compose better.** Pi ships 4 tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`) and lets the model reach everything else through bash. Rubichan currently registers **~36** distinct tools.

The goal is **not** to shrink Rubichan to four tools — it has real, differentiated capability (security engine, wiki pipeline, skills, knowledge graph). The goal is to make those capabilities **modules that plug into a small core**, not fields welded onto a god object.

---

## 3. Current-state assessment

### 3.1 What is already right — keep it

| Property | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Core does **not** depend on the TUI | `grep bubbletea internal/agent` → none. Only `cmd/rubichan/main.go` imports `internal/tui`. |
| Core speaks to the outside via **events**, not UI calls | `Agent.Turn()` returns `<-chan TurnEvent`; the TUI/headless/wiki adapters consume the channel. |
| Provider layer is **interface-based & self-registering** | `LLMProvider` interface (`pkg/agentsdk/provider.go:6`); concretes register via `init()` + `RegisterProvider` (`internal/provider/factory.go`). Adding a provider needs no core change — the cleanest seam in the codebase. |
| Tool registration is **interface-based** | `Tool` interface + `Registry.Register(Tool)` (`internal/tools/registry.go`). |
| SDK **type contracts are unified via aliases** | `internal/tools/interface.go:10` (`Tool = agentsdk.Tool`), `internal/provider/types.go:10` (`LLMProvider = agentsdk.LLMProvider`), `internal/agent/sdk_aliases.go`. The *types* are already one set — only the *loop* is forked. |
| ACP package is **standalone** | `internal/acp` does not import `internal/agent` or `internal/tui`; no cycle. |
| A **public SDK** exists with the intended shape | `pkg/agentsdk` documents `NewAgent(provider, WithTools(…), …).Turn(ctx, msg)` and has zero `internal/` imports. |
| Spec **already mandates** this | ADR-002: *"No UI dependencies in core. Features injected via interfaces."* |

### 3.2 The problems — what blocks "minimal core + modules"

**Problem A — The core is a god object, not a minimal core.**

`internal/agent.Agent` (`internal/agent/agent.go`):
- `agent.go` alone is **2,910 lines**; the struct has **~60 fields**.
- **35** `With…` options on the constructor, each stapling in a concrete subsystem:
  `WithCheckpointManager`, `WithKnowledgeGraph`, `WithMemoryStore`, `WithSessionMemory`, `WithAutoDream`, `WithCompactionStrategies`, `WithCollapseStore`, `WithCacheBreakDetector`, `WithPrefetchManager`, `WithWakeManager`, `WithPersona`(MD), `WithACP`, `WithSkillRuntime`, `WithStore`, `WithUserHooks`, `WithStopHookRegistry`, … .
- The core transitively imports **~18** internal packages: `acp, checkpoint, config, evaluator, hooks, knowledgegraph, persona, provider, session, skills, store, text, toolexec, tools, …`.

Consequence: there is no "just the loop." Every feature is a field. Every new feature grows the struct and the option list. This is the opposite of pi's "small core."

**Problem B — Two divergent stacks (the most important finding).**

| Concept | Public SDK (`pkg/agentsdk`) | Real app (`internal/agent`) |
|---|---|---|
| Agent loop | `agent.go`, **506 lines**, 0 internal imports | `agent.go`, **2,910 lines**, ~18 internal imports |
| `Tool` interface | `pkg/agentsdk/tool.go` | **shared** via alias (`= agentsdk.Tool`) ✔ |
| `Registry` (concrete) | `pkg/agentsdk` Registry | **separate** `internal/tools.Registry` |
| Loop internals | own `runLoop`, `executeTools`, `requestToolApproval` | own `runLoop` (line ~1501), `executeTools`, approval, recovery… |

The good news: the **interfaces are already one set** — `internal/agent` imports `pkg/agentsdk` for types/enums (`Tool`, `LLMProvider`, `AgentDefinition`, `TurnExitReason`, …) and aliases them, so contracts don't drift. The bad news: the **loop is implemented twice**, and `internal/agent`'s loop does **not** call the SDK's. So the "public SDK" is a *parallel, simplified reimplementation* of the loop that has drifted from the code the product actually runs. An external app that embeds `pkg/agentsdk` today gets an agent with **no skills, no compaction, no checkpoint, no knowledge graph, no ACP** — none of what makes Rubichan Rubichan. This directly defeats "easy to bind with other apps."

**Problem C — `main.go` is the true monolith.**

`cmd/rubichan/main.go` is **3,383 lines** and imports ~40 internal packages, wiring providers, tools, skills (including four hard-coded builtin skill packages), security scanners/analyzers, knowledge graph, checkpoint, hooks, persona, ACP, and the TUI in one place. All construction/knowledge of the whole system lives in one file. Any new mode or embedder must re-derive this wiring.

**Problem D — Feature creep has no "edge."**

Capabilities that pi.dev deliberately keeps *outside* the core (todos, plan mode, sub-agents, background bash, prefetch, auto-dream) are all **core struct fields** here. There is no seam that says "this is a module." Adding a capability means editing the core.

**Problem E — The modular seam that exists is scaffolded but not adopted.**

`internal/modes/{interactive,headless,wiki}` are already the *intended* thin adapters — each is a small (161–297-line) ACP client that imports only `internal/acp` + `pkg/agentsdk`, not `internal/agent` or the TUI. That is exactly the right shape. But grepping non-test references shows they are **effectively unwired**: the real interactive, headless, and wiki flows are implemented **inline in `main.go`** (headless around `main.go:2320`, wiki via `wireWiki`/`wiki.Run`, interactive via `tui.NewModel` binding straight to `internal/agent.Agent`). So there are two parallel interactive front-ends — a direct-binding TUI (production) and an ACP-mediated one (`modes/interactive`, dormant). Relatedly, several ACP handlers are explicit stubs (`handleToolExecute` → `"not_implemented"`; `Invoke`/`List`/`Scan` return placeholder values). The elegant "every mode is an ACP client over one core" design is **drawn but not finished** — which is good news for the redesign: the target shape is already sketched in the tree, it just needs to become the real path.

```

**The core knows about a handful of interfaces and nothing else.** Every subsystem that is a field today becomes a **module** registered at composition time.

### 4.1 The extension seams (there should be ~7, not 35)

Most of today's 35 options collapse into a few well-named seams. The core defines the interface; modules implement it; the harness wires them.

> **Placement constraint:** every seam interface below must be defined in `pkg/` (or use only stdlib types), and `pkg/agentsdk` should keep **zero `internal/` imports**. Note the *reason* — it is **not** Go's `internal` visibility rule: because `pkg/agentsdk` sits under the same module root (`github.com/julianshen/rubichan`) as `internal/`, it is actually *permitted* to import `internal/…`, and an external module importing `pkg/agentsdk` still compiles fine. The constraint is architectural, not a compiler requirement: (a) **dependency inversion** — if the SDK imported `internal/skills`/`internal/toolexec`, the "core" would again be welded to concrete subsystems, defeating the whole redesign; and (b) **portability** — it keeps the door open to later extracting the SDK into its *own* Go module (`…/rubichan-sdk`), at which point internal imports genuinely *would* break external consumers. Modules *implement* the interfaces from `internal/`; the core only ever depends on the `pkg/` interface. This is the single hardest invariant to hold during Phase 1 (below) and the one that makes "embed the real agent elsewhere" actually work.

1. **`LLMProvider`** — already exists. Providers are modules. *(No change.)*
2. **`Tool` + `ToolRegistry`** — one interface, promoted to the public package; `internal/tools` implements/uses it instead of redefining it. Tools (incl. skills, MCP) are modules.
3. **`Middleware` (tool execution) + turn-level hooks** — two related but distinct seams:
   - *Tool-execution middleware* — a `before/after Tool` pipeline. **This pattern already exists** as `toolexec.Middleware` (`internal/toolexec/middleware.go`, with `CheckpointMiddleware`, `ClassifierMiddleware`, `HookMiddleware`, `PostHookMiddleware`, `OutputManagerMiddleware`). Use it as the model: **checkpointing, evaluator/classifier, security gating, output offloading, diff tracking** are middlewares, not fields. Promote its `Middleware` type to `pkg/`.
   - *Turn-level hooks* — `before/after Turn` events. Modeled by `internal/hooks` (user-configured shell/HTTP/prompt hooks) plus `internal/agent`'s stop-hook registry; generalize these into one event dispatcher.
4. **`ContextStrategy`** — pluggable context-window management. **Compaction strategies, memory injection, knowledge-graph selection, persona/prompt fragments** become strategies the core calls *synchronously* at prompt-build and post-turn time, rather than ~15 dedicated fields. (**Prefetch is *not* here** — see #7; it is async.)
5. **`EventSink` / observer** — the core already emits `TurnEvent`. Formalize it: TUI, headless formatter, wiki progress, ACP notifications, and session persistence are all just sinks. **`store`, `session`, `activity_summarizer`** attach here.
6. **`Transport`** — direct (in-proc), JSON-stream (headless/CI), and RPC/stdio (ACP). This is how the *same* core serves every mode and every embedder. ACP becomes *a transport*, not a core field.
7. **`BackgroundCoordinator` (async optimizations)** — `prefetch` (`internal/agent/prefetch.go`) is an **asynchronous** optimization: it spawns goroutines to load memory/skill context *in parallel with* the LLM call and consumes the result via a handle. It is a lifecycle/background concern, not a synchronous context strategy — grouping it under #4 would misrepresent its shape. Model it as a background coordinator that a `ContextStrategy` may *consume from*, keeping the sync/async boundary explicit. Auto-dream and other fire-and-forget work attach here too.

Rule of thumb after the redesign: **adding a capability adds a module, never a core struct field.**

### 4.2 Where the modes go

Interactive / Headless / Wiki / ACP stop being "modes the core knows about" (today `WithMode("interactive")` is a core string) and become **adapters**: an `EventSink` + a `Transport` + a tool/middleware selection. The mode-specific `acp_client.go` files (already thin, 161–297 lines) are the right size; they should sit *outside* the core and depend only on the public interfaces.

---

## 5. Migration path — incremental, structural-first, small PRs

This respects `CLAUDE.md`: **separate structural from behavioral changes, structural first, tests green at every step, small focused PRs.** No step below changes behavior; each is a refactor validated by the existing suite.

**Phase 0 — Unify the concrete `Registry` (structural, cheap).**
The `Tool` interface is already shared via alias — good. The remaining fork is the **concrete `Registry`** (`internal/tools.Registry` vs `pkg/agentsdk.Registry`). Pick one canonical registry (promote `internal/tools.Registry` to the public package, or make the SDK re-export it) and delete the other. One tool interface, one registry. *Low risk, removes a maintenance fork.*

**Phase 1 — One loop (the pivotal step).**
Make `internal/agent` build on the `pkg` core loop instead of reimplementing `runLoop`/`executeTools`/approval. Either (a) move the real loop into `pkg` and have the SDK use it directly, or (b) express the SDK as the core and `internal/agent` as core + modules. End state: **exactly one** agent loop. Delete `pkg/agentsdk/agent.go`'s parallel copy or promote it — do not keep both. This is what makes the "embed the *real* agent in another app" story true. **Watch the invariant:** the promoted core must keep zero `internal/` imports (see §4.1 placement constraint). It compiles either way *today* (same module root), so the regression is silent — an accidental `internal/skills`/`internal/toolexec` import re-welds the core to a concrete subsystem and pre-commits the future SDK-as-own-module split to breakage. Gate it in CI with an import-linter rule rather than relying on the compiler to catch it.

> **Status update (post-implementation, 2026-07):** Steps 1–3 of this phase shipped as #298, #299, #300 — `StreamAccumulator`, `ApprovalFlow`, and the tool-execution core (`ExecuteTool` + event constructors) are now single, shared, zero-`internal/`-import implementations in `pkg/agentsdk`, used by both loops with byte-identical wire shapes and unmodified existing test suites throughout. `internal/agent.Agent` shrank from 2,910 to 2,786 lines.
>
> **A 4th step — literally making `internal/agent`'s `runLoop` call into `pkg/agentsdk`'s `runLoop`, or vice versa — turned out not to be a mechanical next step.** What remains of `internal/agent`'s `runLoop` (~615 lines) is not duplication with the SDK's `runLoop` (~60 lines); it's orchestration for roughly 15 internal-only subsystems that have no SDK counterpart at all: skill activation, compaction, prompt-fragment/cache-breakpoint assembly, tool deferral/budget, prefetch, provider retry+fallback+escalation (a real recovery state machine — `errorclass.Classify` + `withheldErrors` + `attemptRecovery` — vs. the SDK's simple context-overflow check on a structured provider interface; these are two different designs for the same problem, not duplicate code), no-progress detection, task_complete signaling, wake events, session memory, and auto-dream. Two concrete candidates were checked and rejected as unsafe merges: `makeDoneEvent` (internal's reads `a.context.Budget()` / `a.diffTracker`, both internal-only) and stream-error classification (structurally different mechanisms, not shared logic).
>
> **The real blocker: Phase 1's "one loop" goal is gated on Phase 2's module seams existing first**, not the other way around as originally sequenced above. Those ~15 subsystems *are* the feature modules Phase 2 describes extracting behind `Middleware` / `ContextStrategy` / `BackgroundCoordinator` / `Transport`. Until those seams exist, there is nothing for a shared loop to plug them into — the loop skeleton and the modules have to be designed together. Forcing a merge now would mean either (a) growing the SDK's public loop to embed 615 lines of internal-only orchestration (an immediate `internal/` import, violating the zero-import invariant this same section calls out), or (b) a big-bang rewrite inventing all of Phase 2's seams at once under one PR — exactly what §6 Risks warns against.
>
> **Revised plan:** treat "one loop" as complete for the parts that were genuinely safe to unify (done: accumulation, approval, execution — the primitives). Re-sequence the remainder as Phase 2 first (introduce one seam at a time, migrating one subsystem behind it per PR, same Tidy-First discipline as steps 1–3) and revisit full loop unification once enough subsystems have moved behind seams that what's left in `internal/agent.runLoop` is small enough to converge safely. Phase 1 and Phase 2 are therefore interleaved in practice, not sequential.

**Phase 2 — Extract feature modules out of the god struct (structural, one subsystem per PR).**
For each subsystem, introduce the right seam interface and move it behind it, replacing the `With…` field option with a `Use(module)` registration: checkpoint/evaluator/security → *tool-execution middleware* (`toolexec.Middleware`); knowledge-graph/memory/persona/prompt-fragments/compaction → *`ContextStrategy`*; prefetch/auto-dream → *`BackgroundCoordinator`* (async); ACP → *`Transport`*. Struct shrinks one subsystem at a time; tests stay green.

> **Status update (2026-07):** Two of the four seams are in place.
> *Middleware* (#302–#304): `Pipeline`/`Middleware` promoted to `pkg/agentsdk`; composition is agent-owned (`WithToolMiddlewares` slots around a core chain of canonicalize → hooks → checkpoint → fused verdict+offload), which revived three production subsystems that main.go's wholesale `WithPipeline` replacement had silently dropped; hook dispatch (before and after) has a single site in the pipeline.
> *BackgroundCoordinator*: `agentsdk.BackgroundTask` — started before each model call, joined after tool execution, signalled at session end on every loop exit. Prefetch and auto-dream moved behind it; their dedicated Agent fields are gone and the loop dispatches generically. Moving auto-dream fixed a latent placement defect (its trigger sat only on the max-turns exit, so normally-ending sessions never consolidated). Note: neither prefetch nor auto-dream is currently registered by `cmd/rubichan/main.go` — wiring them into the product is a pending product decision, separate from the seam.
> *Transport*: ACP is no longer a core field — `WithACP`/`ACPServer()` and the `acpServer`/`acpRegistry`/`useACP` fields are gone; `agent.NewACPServer(core)` composes the JSON-RPC server over a plain agent at the composition root. Notable: production (`cmd/rubichan/main.go`) had been constructing an ACP server on every run and never serving it — `ACPServer()` had zero non-test callers — so main simply dropped its `WithACP` lines.
> *BackgroundCoordinator addendum*: session-memory extraction (async, per the same rule that keeps prefetch out of ContextStrategy) moved onto the seam as a built-in task — its join counts each tool round and spawns the gated extraction; terminal tool turns now participate, fixing the silent loss of a session's final round.
> *ContextStrategy* (in progress, sliced): the prompt-build moment is done — `agentsdk.ContextStrategy` contributes system-prompt sections synchronously at prompt-build time (`WithContextStrategies`, per-strategy recover boundaries), and the four built-in dynamic sections (scratchpad, progress, knowledge-graph selection, cross-session memories) are now built-in strategies prepended in canonical order, collapsing their inline blocks in `buildSystemPromptWithFragments` into one dispatch loop. Compaction was already pluggable via `CompactionStrategy`/`SetStrategies`. Remaining slices: skill prompt fragments + before-prompt-build hook mutation (deeply entangled with the skill runtime), persona/static prompt assembly, and the post-turn moment.

**Phase 3 — Adapters over the core.**
Reduce `cmd/rubichan/main.go` to composition only: build core, register modules, pick an adapter. Move mode wiring into `internal/modes/*` (or `pkg` for reusable ones). Target: `main.go` under a few hundred lines.

**Phase 4 — Publish the module API.**
Document the ~7 seams in `pkg/…` with examples (`examples/` already exists). External apps now embed the **real** core and opt into exactly the modules they want (e.g. a NATS bridge with tools + checkpoint but no TUI).

Each phase is independently shippable and leaves the product fully working.

## 6. Risks & trade-offs

- **Refactor scope is large.** Mitigation: the phased, structural-first plan above — behavior-preserving steps, existing tests as the guardrail, `>90%` coverage rule enforced per PR. Do **not** attempt a big-bang rewrite.
- **Over-abstraction (YAGNI).** Seven seams is the budget; resist inventing a plugin manager for things that have one implementation. A module seam earns its place only when there are ≥2 implementations or a real external embedder.
- **Interface churn at the ContextStrategy seam.** Compaction/memory/knowledge are genuinely entangled with the loop; expect to iterate on that interface. Land it last (Phase 2 tail) once the cheaper wins are in.
- **Tool-count question is separate.** Whether Rubichan should follow pi and push some of its ~36 tools out to CLIs/skills (progressive disclosure, smaller context tax) is a *product* decision, not required by this refactor. Worth a follow-up, but out of scope here.
- **ACP positioning.** CLAUDE.md frames ACP as the backbone. This proposal keeps ACP first-class but reframes it as **a transport** over the shared core rather than a field baked into the agent — which actually strengthens the "standardized backbone for any client" story.

## 7. Answer to the question

> Can we redesign to a minimum core with modules, so we don't bind everything together (like TUI), making it more extendable and easy to bind with other apps?

**Yes.** The intended architecture (ADR-002: shared, UI-free core; features injected via interfaces) is already the stated design, and the good bones are present — event-driven core, UI only at the edge, interface-based providers and tools, a standalone ACP package, and even a public SDK skeleton. What has happened in practice is **drift**: the core grew into a 60-field god object, and the SDK forked into a second, weaker implementation.

The redesign is therefore **consolidation, not invention**: unify the duplicated loop/tool/registry, define ~7 module seams, and move today's 35 baked-in options out to modules — turning "everything compiled together" into "a tiny core plus the modules this deployment chose." That is precisely pi.dev's "small core with programmable edges," and it makes embedding Rubichan in another app a matter of picking modules and a transport instead of inheriting the TUI.
